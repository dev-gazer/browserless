# browserless - v0.1.0

browserless is a Qt Based web browser application. There are no special features yet, but I bet you will gaze the hell out of it soon enough.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- An up to date Qt Creator
- Qt webkitwidgets (a simple sudo apt-get install libqt5webkit5-dev should do the trick)
- Shoegaze enough to run it

#### Clone the project

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/dev-gazer/browserless.git
```

#### Go inside the project folder and launch Qt Creator.
```sh
$ cd browserless
$ qtcreator .
```

#### Build and run the project using qmake.

## How to use it

Run it like any normal browser. Expect more to be added soon, right?
